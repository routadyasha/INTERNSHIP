       " \"XLA\\nXLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) is an open-source machine learning (ML) compiler for GPUs, CPUs, and ML accelerators.\\nThe XLA compiler takes models from popular ML frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX, and optimizes them for high-performance execution across different hardware platforms including GPUs, CPUs, and ML accelerators.\\nGet started\\nIf you want to use XLA to compile your ML project, refer to the corresponding documentation for your ML framework:\\nPyTorch\\nTensorFlow\\nJAX\\nIf you're not contributing code to the XLA compiler, you don't need to clone and build this repo. Everything here is intended for XLA contributors who want to develop the compiler and XLA integrators who want to debug or add support for ML frontends and hardware backends.\\nHere's how you can start developing in the XLA compiler:\\nTo build XLA, you will need to install Bazel. Bazelisk is an easy way to install Bazel and automatically downloads the correct Bazel version for XLA. If Bazelisk is unavailable, you can manually install Bazel instead.\\nClone this repository:\\ngit clone https://github.com/openxla/xla && cd xla\\nWe recommend using a suitable docker container to build/test XLA, such as TensorFlow's docker container:\\ndocker run --name xla -w /xla -it -d --rm -v $PWD:/xla tensorflow/build:latest-python3.9 bash\\nRun an end to end test using an example StableHLO module:\\ndocker exec xla ./configure\\ndocker exec xla bazel test xla/examples/axpy:stablehlo_compile_test --nocheck_visibility --test_output=all\\nThis will take quite a while your first time because it must build the entire stack, including MLIR, StableHLO, XLA, and more.\\nWhen it's done, you should see output like this:\\n==================== Test output for //xla/examples/axpy:stablehlo_compile_test:\\n[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.\\n[----------] Global test environment set-up.\\n[----------] 1 test from StableHloAxpyTest\\n[ RUN      ] StableHloAxpyTest.LoadAndRunCpuExecutable\\nLoaded StableHLO program from xla/examples/axpy/stablehlo_axpy.mlir:\\nfunc.func @main(\\n  %alpha: tensor<f32>, %x: tensor<4xf32>, %y: tensor<4xf32>\\n) -> tensor<4xf32> {\\n  %0 = stablehlo.broadcast_in_dim %alpha, dims = []\\n    : (tensor<f32>) -> tensor<4xf32>\\n  %1 = stablehlo.multiply %0, %x : tensor<4xf32>\\n  %2 = stablehlo.add %1, %y : tensor<4xf32>\\n  func.return %2: tensor<4xf32>\\n}\\n\\nComputation inputs:\\n        alpha:f32[] 3.14\\n        x:f32[4] {1, 2, 3, 4}\\n        y:f32[4] {10.5, 20.5, 30.5, 40.5}\\nComputation output: f32[4] {13.64, 26.78, 39.920002, 53.06}\\n[       OK ] StableHloAxpyTest.LoadAndRunCpuExecutable (264 ms)\\n[----------] 1 test from StableHloAxpyTest (264 ms total)\\n\\n[----------] Global test environment tear-down\\n[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran.

       " 'OWASP API Security Top 10\\nThis project is designed to address the ever-increasing number of organizations that are deploying potentially sensitive APIs as part of their software offerings. These APIs are used for internal tasks and to interface with third parties. Unfortunately, many APIs do not undergo the rigorous security testing that would help make them secure from an attack.\\nThe OWASP API Security Project seeks to provide value to software developers and security assessors by underscoring the potential risks in insecure APIs, and illustrating how these risks may be mitigated. In order to facilitate this goal, the OWASP API Security Project will create and maintain a Top 10 API Security Risks document, as well as a documentation portal for best practices when creating or assessing APIs.\\nDescription\\nWhile working as developers or information security consultants, many people have encountered APIs as part of a project. While there are some resources to help create and evaluate these projects (such as the OWASP REST Security Cheat Sheet), there has not be a comprehensive security project designed to assist builders, breakers, and defenders in the community.\\nThis project aims to:\\nCreate the OWASP Top Ten API Security Risks document, which can easily underscore the most common risks in the area.\\nCreate a documentation portal for developers to build APIs in a secure manner.\\nWork closely with the security community to maintain living documents that evolve with security trends.\\nProject Leaders\\nErez Yalon\\nInon Shkedy\\nPaulo Silva\\nLicensing\\nThe OWASP API Security Project documents are free to use!\\nThe OWASP API Security Project is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license, so you can copy, distribute, and transmit the work.

As an example, here is a video of running the model on an iPhone 13 device - fully offline, on-device: whisper.objc\\nYou can also easily make your own offline voice assistant application: command\\nOr you can even run it straight in the browser: talk.wasm\\nImplementation details\\nThe core tensor operations are implemented in C (ggml.h / ggml.c)\\nThe transformer model and the high-level C-style API are implemented in C++ (whisper.h / whisper.cpp)\\nSample usage is demonstrated in main.cpp\\nSample real-time audio transcription from the microphone is demonstrated in stream.cpp\\nVarious other examples are available in the examples folder\\nThe tensor operators are optimized heavily for Apple silicon CPUs. Depending on the computation size, Arm Neon SIMD instrisics or CBLAS Accelerate framework routines are used.

       " 'Build multimodal AI services with cloud native technologies\\nJina is an MLOps framework to build multimodal AI services and pipelines then serve, scale and deploy them to a production-ready environment like Kubernetes or Jina AI Cloud. Jina handles the infrastructure complexity, making advanced solution engineering and cloud-native technologies accessible to every developer.\\nBuild and deploy a gRPC microservice • Build and deploy a pipeline\\nApplications built with Jina enjoy the following features out of the box:\\n🌌 Universal\\nBuild applications that deliver fresh insights from multiple data types such as text, image, audio, video, 3D mesh, PDF with LF\\'s DocArray.\\nSupport for all mainstream deep learning frameworks.\\nPolyglot gateway that supports gRPC, Websockets, HTTP, GraphQL protocols with TLS.\\n⚡ Performance\\nIntuitive design pattern for high-performance microservices.\\nEasy scaling: set replicas, sharding in one line.\\nDuplex streaming between client and server.\\nAsync and non-blocking data processing over dynamic flows.\\n☁️ Cloud native\\nSeamless Docker container integration: sharing, exploring, sandboxing, versioning and dependency control via Executor Hub.\\nFull observability via OpenTelemetry, Prometheus and Grafana.\\nFast deployment to Kubernetes and Docker Compose.\\n🍱 Ecosystem\\nImproved engineering efficiency thanks to the Jina AI ecosystem, so you can focus on innovating with the data applications you build.\\nFree CPU/GPU hosting via Jina AI Cloud.\\nDocumentation\\nInstall\\npip install jina\\nFind more install options on Apple Silicon/Windows.\\nGet Started\\nBasic Concepts\\nJina has three fundamental concepts:\\nA Document (from DocArray) is the input/output format in Jina.\\nAn Executor is a Python class that transforms and processes Documents.\\nA Deployment serves a single Executor, while a Flow serves Executors chained into a pipeline.\\nThe full glossary is explained here.\\nBuild AI Services\\nLet\\'s build a fast, reliable and scalable gRPC-based AI service. In Jina we call this an Executor. Our simple Executor will use Facebook\\'s mBART-50 model to translate French to English. We\\'ll then use a Deployment to serve it.\\nNote A Deployment serves just one Executor. To combine multiple Executors into a pipeline and serve that, use a Flow.\\nNote Run the code in Colab to install all dependencies.\\nLet\\'s implement the service\\'s logic:\\ntranslate_executor.py\\nfrom docarray import DocumentArray\\nfrom jina import Executor, requests\\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM\\n\\n\\nclass Translator(Executor):\\n    def __init__(self, **kwargs):\\n        super().__init__(**kwargs)\\n        self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\\n            \"facebook/mbart-large-50-many-to-many-mmt\", src_lang=\"fr_XX\"\\n        )\\n        self.model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(\\n            \"facebook/mbart-large-50-many-to-many-mmt\"\\n        )\\n\\n    @requests\\n    def translate(self, docs: DocumentArray, **kwargs):\\n        for doc in docs:\\n            doc.text = self._translate(doc.text)\\n\\n    def _translate(self, text):\\n        encoded_en = self.tokenizer(text, return_tensors=\"pt\")\\n        generated_tokens = self.model.generate(\\n            **encoded_en, forced_bos_token_id=self.tokenizer.lang_code_to_id[\"en_XX\"]\\n        )\\n        return self.tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_tokens, skip_special_tokens=True)[\\n            0\\n        ]\\nThen we deploy it with either the Python API or YAML:\\nPython API: deployment.py YAML: deployment.yml\\nfrom jina import Deployment\\n\\nwith Deployment(uses=Translator, timeout_ready=-1) as dep:\\n    dep.block()\\njtype: Deployment\\nwith:\\n  uses: Translator\\n  py_modules:\\n    - translate_executor.py # name of the module containing Translator\\n  timeout_ready: -1\\nAnd run the YAML Deployment with the CLI: jina deployment --uses deployment.yml\\n──────────────────────────────────────── 🎉 Deployment is ready to serve! ─────────────────────────────────────────\\n╭────────────── 🔗 Endpoint ───────────────╮\\n│  ⛓      Protocol                   GRPC │\\n│  🏠        Local          0.0.0.0:12345  │\\n│  🔒      Private      172.28.0.12:12345  │\\n│  🌍       Public    35.230.97.208:12345  │\\n╰──────────────────────────────────────────╯\\nUse Jina Client to make requests to the service:\\nfrom docarray import Document\\nfrom jina import Client\\n\\nfrench_text = Document(\\n    text=\\'un astronaut est en train de faire une promenade dans un parc\\'\\n)\\n\\nclient = Client(port=12345)  # use port from output above\\nresponse = client.post(on=\\'/\\', inputs=[french_text])\\n\\nprint(response[0].text)\\nan astronaut is walking in a park\\nNote In a notebook, one cannot use deployment.block() and then make requests to the client. Please refer to the colab link above for reproducible Jupyter Notebook code snippets.\\nBuild a pipeline\\nSometimes you want to chain microservices together into a pipeline. That\\'s where a Flow comes in.\\nA Flow is a DAG pipeline, composed of a set of steps, It orchestrates a set of Executors and a Gateway to offer an end-to-end service.\\nNote If you just want to serve a single Executor, you can use a Deployment.\\nFor instance, let\\'s combine our French translation service with a Stable Diffusion image generation service from Jina AI\\'s Executor Hub. Chaining these services together into a Flow will give us a multilingual image generation service.\\nBuild the Flow with either Python or YAML:\\nPython API: flow.py YAML: flow.yml\\nfrom jina import Flow\\n\\nflow = (\\n    Flow()\\n    .add(uses=Translator, timeout_ready=-1)\\n    .add(\\n        uses=\\'jinaai://jina-ai/TextToImage\\',\\n        timeout_ready=-1,\\n        install_requirements=True,\\n    )\\n)  # use the Executor from Executor hub\\n\\nwith flow:\\n    flow.block()\\njtype: Flow\\nexecutors:\\n  - uses: Translator\\n    timeout_ready: -1\\n    py_modules:\\n      - translate_executor.py\\n  - uses: jinaai://jina-ai/TextToImage\\n    timeout_ready: -1\\n    install_requirements: true\\nThen run the YAML Flow with the CLI: jina flow --uses flow.yml\\n─────────────────────────────────────────── 🎉 Flow is ready to serve! ────────────────────────────────────────────\\n╭────────────── 🔗 Endpoint ───────────────╮\\n│  ⛓      Protocol                   GRPC  │\\n│  🏠        Local          0.0.0.0:12345  │\\n│  🔒      Private      172.28.0.12:12345  │\\n│  🌍       Public    35.240.201.66:12345  │\\n╰──────────────────────────────────────────╯\\nThen, use Jina Client to make requests to the Flow:\\nfrom jina import Client, Document\\n\\nclient = Client(port=12345)  # use port from output above\\n\\nfrench_text = Document(\\n    text=\\'un astronaut est en train de faire une promenade dans un parc\\'\\n)\\n\\nresponse = client.post(on=\\'/\\', inputs=[french_text])\\n\\nresponse[0].display()\\nYou can also deploy a Flow to JCloud.\\nFirst, turn the flow.yml file into a JCloud-compatible YAML by specifying resource requirements and using containerized Hub Executors.\\nThen, use jina cloud deploy command to deploy to the cloud:\\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jina-ai/jina/master/.github/getting-started/jcloud-flow.yml\\njina cloud deploy jcloud-flow.yml\\n⚠️ Caution: Make sure to delete/clean up the Flow once you are done with this tutorial to save resources and credits.\\nRead more about deploying Flows to JCloud.\\nCheck the getting-started project source code.\\nWhy not just use standard Python to build that microservice and pipeline? Jina accelerates time to market of your application by making it more scalable and cloud-native. Jina also handles the infrastructure complexity in production and other Day-2 operations so that you can focus on the data application itself.\\nEasy scalability and concurrency\\nJina comes with scalability features out of the box like replicas, shards and dynamic batching. This lets you easily increase your application\\'s throughput.\\nLet\\'s scale a Stable Diffusion Executor deployment with replicas and dynamic batching:\\nCreate two replicas, with a GPU assigned for each.\\nEnable dynamic batching to process incoming parallel requests together with the same model inference.\\nNormal Deployment Scaled Deployment\\njtype: Deployment\\nwith:\\n  timeout_ready: -1\\n  uses: jinaai://jina-ai/TextToImage\\n  install_requirements: true\\njtype: Deployment\\nwith:\\n  timeout_ready: -1\\n  uses: jinaai://jina-ai/TextToImage\\n  install_requirements: true\\n  env:\\n   CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES: RR\\n  replicas: 2\\n  uses_dynamic_batching: # configure dynamic batching\\n    /default:\\n      preferred_batch_size: 10\\n      timeout: 200\\nAssuming your machine has two GPUs, using the scaled deployment YAML will give better throughput compared to the normal deployment.\\nThese features apply to both Deployment YAML and Flow YAML. Thanks to the YAML syntax, you can inject deployment configurations regardless of Executor code.\\nSeamless container integration\\nUse Executor Hub to share your Executors or use public/private Executors, with no need to worry about dependencies.\\nTo create an Executor:\\njina hub new \\nTo push it to Executor Hub:\\njina hub push .\\nTo use a Hub Executor in your Flow:\\nDocker container Sandbox Source\\nYAML uses: jinaai+docker://<username>/MyExecutor uses: jinaai+sandbox://<username>/MyExecutor uses: jinaai://<username>/MyExecutor\\nPython .add(uses=\\'jinaai+docker://<username>/MyExecutor\\') .add(uses=\\'jinaai+sandbox://<username>/MyExecutor\\') .add(uses=\\'jinaai://<username>/MyExecutor\\')\\nExecutor Hub manages everything on the backend:\\nAutomated builds on the cloud\\nStore, deploy, and deliver Executors cost-efficiently;\\nAutomatically resolve version conflicts and dependencies;\\nInstant delivery of any Executor via Sandbox without pulling anything to local.\\nGet on the fast lane to cloud-native\\nUsing Kubernetes with Jina is easy:\\njina export kubernetes flow.yml ./my-k8s\\nkubectl apply -R -f my-k8s\\nAnd so is Docker Compose:\\njina export docker-compose flow.yml docker-compose.yml\\ndocker-compose up\\nNote You can also export Deployment YAML to Kubernetes and Docker Compose.\\nLikewise, tracing and monitoring with OpenTelemetry is straightforward:\\nfrom docarray import DocumentArray\\nfrom jina import Executor, requests\\n\\n\\nclass Encoder(Executor):\\n    @requests\\n    def encode(self, docs: DocumentArray, **kwargs):\\n        with self.tracer.start_as_current_span(\\n            \\'encode\\', context=tracing_context\\n        ) as span:\\n            with self.monitor(\\n                \\'preprocessing_seconds\\', \\'Time preprocessing the requests\\'\\n            ):\\n                docs.tensors = preprocessing(docs)\\n            with self.monitor(\\n                \\'model_inference_seconds\\', \\'Time doing inference the requests\\'\\n            ):\\n                docs.embedding = model_inference(docs.tensors)\\nYou can integrate Jaeger or any other distributed tracing tools to collect and visualize request-level and application level service operation attributes. This helps you analyze request-response lifecycle, application behavior and performance.\\nTo use Grafana, download this JSON and import it into Grafana:\\nTo trace requests with Jaeger:\\nWhat cloud-native technology is still challenging to you?

Linux\\nDeprecated\\nThese collectors are deprecated and will be removed in the next major release.\\nName Description OS\\nntp Exposes local NTP daemon health to check time any\\nPerf Collector\\nThe perf collector may not work out of the box on some Linux systems due to kernel configuration and security settings. To allow access, set the following sysctl parameter:\\nsysctl -w kernel.perf_event_paranoid=X\\n2 allow only user-space measurements (default since Linux 4.6).\\n1 allow both kernel and user measurements (default before Linux 4.6).\\n0 allow access to CPU-specific data but not raw tracepoint samples.\\n-1 no restrictions.\\nDepending on the configured value different metrics will be available, for most cases 0 will provide the most complete set. For more information see man 2 perf_event_open.\\nBy default, the perf collector will only collect metrics of the CPUs that node_exporter is running on (ie runtime.NumCPU. If this is insufficient (e.g. if you run node_exporter with its CPU affinity set to specific CPUs), you can specify a list of alternate CPUs by using the --collector.perf.cpus flag. For example, to collect metrics on CPUs 2-6, you would specify: --collector.perf --collector.perf.cpus=2-6. The CPU configuration is zero indexed and can also take a stride value; e.g. --collector.perf --collector.perf.cpus=1-10:5 would collect on CPUs 1, 5, and 10.\\nThe perf collector is also able to collect tracepoint counts when using the --collector.perf.tracepoint flag. Tracepoints can be found using perf list or from debugfs. And example usage of this would be --collector.perf.tracepoint=\"sched:sched_process_exec\".\\nSysctl Collector\\nThe sysctl collector can be enabled with --collector.sysctl. It supports exposing numeric sysctl values as metrics using the --collector.sysctl.include flag and string values as info metrics by using the --collector.sysctl.include-info flag. The flags can be repeated. For sysctl with multiple numeric values, an optional mapping can be given to expose each value as its own metric. Otherwise an index label is used to identify the different fields.\\nExamples\\nNumeric values\\nSingle values\\nUsing --collector.sysctl.include=vm.user_reserve_kbytes: vm.user_reserve_kbytes = 131072 -> node_sysctl_vm_user_reserve_kbytes 131072\\nMultiple values\\nA sysctl can contain multiple values, for example:\\nnet.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 131072 6291456\\nUsing --collector.sysctl.include=net.ipv4.tcp_rmem the collector will expose:\\nnode_sysctl_net_ipv4_tcp_rmem{index=\"0\"} 4096\\nnode_sysctl_net_ipv4_tcp_rmem{index=\"1\"} 131072\\nnode_sysctl_net_ipv4_tcp_rmem{index=\"2\"} 6291456\\nIf the indexes have defined meaning like in this case, the values can be mapped to multiple metrics by appending the mapping to the --collector.sysctl.include flag: Using --collector.sysctl.include=net.ipv4.tcp_rmem:min,default,max the collector will expose:\\nnode_sysctl_net_ipv4_tcp_rmem_min 4096\\nnode_sysctl_net_ipv4_tcp_rmem_default 131072\\nnode_sysctl_net_ipv4_tcp_rmem_max 6291456\\nString values\\nString values need to be exposed as info metric. The user selects them by using the --collector.sysctl.include-info flag.\\nSingle values\\nkernel.core_pattern = core -> node_sysctl_info{key=\"kernel.core_pattern_info\", value=\"core\"} 1\\nMultiple values\\nGiven the following sysctl:\\nkernel.seccomp.actions_avail = kill_process kill_thread trap errno trace log allow\\nSetting --collector.sysctl.include-info=kernel.seccomp.actions_avail will yield:\\nnode_sysctl_info{key=\"kernel.seccomp.actions_avail\", index=\"0\", value=\"kill_process\"} 1\\nnode_sysctl_info{key=\"kernel.seccomp.actions_avail\", index=\"1\", value=\"kill_thread\"} 1\\n...\\nTextfile Collector\\nThe textfile collector is similar to the Pushgateway, in that it allows exporting of statistics from batch jobs. It can also be used to export static metrics, such as what role a machine has. The Pushgateway should be used for service-level metrics. The textfile module is for metrics that are tied to a machine.\\nTo use it, set the --collector.textfile.directory flag on the node_exporter commandline. The collector will parse all files in that directory matching the glob *.prom using the text format. Note: Timestamps are not supported.\\nTo atomically push completion time for a cron job:\\necho my_batch_job_completion_time $(date +%s) > /path/to/directory/my_batch_job.prom.$$\\nmv /path/to/directory/my_batch_job.prom.$$ /path/to/directory/my_batch_job.prom\\nTo statically set roles for a machine using labels:\\necho \\'role{role=\"application_server\"} 1\\' > /path/to/directory/role.prom.$$\\nmv /path/to/directory/role.prom.$$ /path/to/directory/role.prom\\nFiltering enabled collectors\\nThe node_exporter will expose all metrics from enabled collectors by default. This is the recommended way to collect metrics to avoid errors when comparing metrics of different families.\\nFor advanced use the node_exporter can be passed an optional list of collectors to filter metrics. The collect[] parameter may be used multiple times. In Prometheus configuration you can use this syntax under the scrape config.\\n  params:\\n    collect[]:\\n      - foo\\n      - bar\\nThis can be useful for having different Prometheus servers collect specific metrics from nodes.\\nDevelopment building and running\\nPrerequisites:\\nGo compiler\\nRHEL/CentOS: glibc-static package.\\nBuilding:\\ngit clone https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter.git\\ncd node_exporter\\nmake build\\n./node_exporter <flags>\\nTo see all available configuration flags:\\n./node_exporter -h\\nRunning tests\\nmake test\\nTLS endpoint\\n** EXPERIMENTAL **\\nThe exporter supports TLS via a new web configuration file.\\n./node_exporter --web.config.file=web-config.yml\\nSee the exporter-toolkit https package for more details.',\n",

LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\\n📚 Data Augmented Generation:\\nData Augmented Generation involves specific types of chains that first interact with an external datasource to fetch data to use in the generation step. Examples of this include summarization of long pieces of text and question/answering over specific data sources.\\n🤖 Agents:\\nAgents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\\n🧠 Memory:\\nMemory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\\n🧐 Evaluation:\\n[BETA] Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation.

       " \"README for Mbed TLS\\nMbed TLS is a C library that implements cryptographic primitives, X.509 certificate manipulation and the SSL/TLS and DTLS protocols. Its small code footprint makes it suitable for embedded systems.\\nMbed TLS includes a reference implementation of the PSA Cryptography API. This is currently a preview for evaluation purposes only.\\nConfiguration\\nMbed TLS should build out of the box on most systems. Some platform specific options are available in the fully documented configuration file include/mbedtls/mbedtls_config.h, which is also the place where features can be selected. This file can be edited manually, or in a more programmatic way using the Python 3 script scripts/config.py (use --help for usage instructions).\\nCompiler options can be set using conventional environment variables such as CC and CFLAGS when using the Make and CMake build system (see below).\\nWe provide some non-standard configurations focused on specific use cases in the configs/ directory. You can read more about those in configs/README.txt\\nDocumentation\\nThe main Mbed TLS documentation is available via ReadTheDocs.\\nDocumentation for the PSA Cryptography API is available on GitHub.\\nTo generate a local copy of the library documentation in HTML format, tailored to your compile-time configuration:\\nMake sure that Doxygen is installed.\\nRun make apidoc.\\nBrowse apidoc/index.html or apidoc/modules.html.\\nFor other sources of documentation, see the SUPPORT document.\\nCompiling\\nThere are currently three active build systems used within Mbed TLS releases:\\nGNU Make\\nCMake\\nMicrosoft Visual Studio\\nThe main systems used for development are CMake and GNU Make. Those systems are always complete and up-to-date. The others should reflect all changes present in the CMake and Make build system, although features may not be ported there automatically.\\nThe Make and CMake build systems create three libraries: libmbedcrypto, libmbedx509, and libmbedtls. Note that libmbedtls depends on libmbedx509 and libmbedcrypto, and libmbedx509 depends on libmbedcrypto. As a result, some linkers will expect flags to be in a specific order, for example the GNU linker wants -lmbedtls -lmbedx509 -lmbedcrypto.\\nTool versions\\nYou need the following tools to build the library with the provided makefiles:\\nGNU Make 3.82 or a build tool that CMake supports.\\nA C99 toolchain (compiler, linker, archiver). We actively test with GCC 5.4, Clang 3.8, IAR 8 and Visual Studio 2013. More recent versions should work. Slightly older versions may work.\\nPython 3.6 to generate the test code, and to generate sample programs in the development branch.\\nPerl to run the tests, and to generate some source files in the development branch.\\nCMake 3.10.2 or later (if using CMake).\\nMicrosoft Visual Studio 2013 or later (if using Visual Studio).\\nDoxygen 1.8.11 or later (if building the documentation; slightly older versions should work).\\nGenerated source files in the development branch\\nThe source code of Mbed TLS includes some files that are automatically generated by scripts and whose content depends only on the Mbed TLS source, not on the platform or on the library configuration. These files are not included in the development branch of Mbed TLS, but the generated files are included in official releases. This section explains how to generate the missing files in the development branch.\\nThe following tools are required:\\nPerl, for some library source files and for Visual Studio build files.\\nPython 3 and some Python packages, for some library source files, sample programs and test data. To install the necessary packages, run\\npython -m pip install -r scripts/basic.requirements.txt\\nA C compiler for the host platform, for some test data.\\nIf you are cross-compiling, you must set the CC environment variable to a C compiler for the host platform when generating the configuration-independent files.\\nAny of the following methods are available to generate the configuration-independent files:\\nIf not cross-compiling, running make with any target, or just make, will automatically generate required files.\\nOn non-Windows systems, when not cross-compiling, CMake will generate the required files automatically.\\nRun make generated_files to generate all the configuration-independent files.\\nOn Unix/POSIX systems, run tests/scripts/check-generated-files.sh -u to generate all the configuration-independent files.\\nOn Windows, run scripts\\\\make_generated_files.bat to generate all the configuration-independent files.\\nMake\\nWe require GNU Make. To build the library and the sample programs, GNU Make and a C compiler are sufficient. Some of the more advanced build targets require some Unix/Linux tools.\\nWe intentionally only use a minimum of functionality in the makefiles in order to keep them as simple and independent of different toolchains as possible, to allow users to more easily move between different platforms. Users who need more features are recommended to use CMake.\\nIn order to build from the source code using GNU Make, just enter at the command line:\\nmake\\nIn order to run the tests, enter:\\nmake check\\nThe tests need Python to be built and Perl to be run. If you don't have one of them installed, you can skip building the tests with:\\nmake no_test\\nYou'll still be able to run a much smaller set of tests with:\\nprograms/test/selftest\\nIn order to build for a Windows platform, you should use WINDOWS_BUILD=1 if the target is Windows but the build environment is Unix-like (for instance when cross-compiling, or compiling from an MSYS shell), and WINDOWS=1 if the build environment is a Windows shell (for instance using mingw32-make) (in that case some targets will not be available).\\nSetting the variable SHARED in your environment will build shared libraries in addition to the static libraries. Setting DEBUG gives you a debug build. You can override CFLAGS and LDFLAGS by setting them in your environment or on the make command line; compiler warning options may be overridden separately using WARNING_CFLAGS. Some directory-specific options (for example, -I directives) are still preserved.\\nPlease note that setting CFLAGS overrides its default value of -O2 and setting WARNING_CFLAGS overrides its default value (starting with -Wall -Wextra), so if you just want to add some warning options to the default ones, you can do so by setting CFLAGS=-O2 -Werror for example. Setting WARNING_CFLAGS is useful when you want to get rid of its default content (for example because your compiler doesn't accept -Wall as an option). Directory-specific options cannot be overridden from the command line.\\nDepending on your platform, you might run into some issues. Please check the Makefiles in library/, programs/ and tests/ for options to manually add or remove for specific platforms. You can also check the Mbed TLS Knowledge Base for articles on your platform or issue.\\nIn case you find that you need to do something else as well, please let us know what, so we can add it to the Mbed TLS Knowledge Base.\\nCMake\\nIn order to build the source using CMake in a separate directory (recommended), just enter at the command line:\\nmkdir /path/to/build_dir && cd /path/to/build_dir\\ncmake /path/to/mbedtls_source\\ncmake --build .\\nIn order to run the tests, enter:\\nctest\\nThe test suites need Python to be built and Perl to be executed. If you don't have one of these installed, you'll want to disable the test suites with:\\ncmake -DENABLE_TESTING=Off /path/to/mbedtls_source\\nIf you disabled the test suites, but kept the programs enabled, you can still run a much smaller set of tests with:\\nprograms/test/selftest\\nTo configure CMake for building shared libraries, use:\\ncmake -DUSE_SHARED_MBEDTLS_LIBRARY=On /path/to/mbedtls_source\\nThere are many different build modes available within the CMake buildsystem. Most of them are available for gcc and clang, though some are compiler-specific:\\nRelease. This generates the default code without any unnecessary information in the binary files.\\nDebug. This generates debug information and disables optimization of the code.\\nCoverage. This generates code coverage information in addition to debug information.\\nASan. This instruments the code with AddressSanitizer to check for memory errors. (This includes LeakSanitizer, with recent version of gcc and clang.) (With recent version of clang, this mode also instruments the code with UndefinedSanitizer to check for undefined behaviour.)\\nASanDbg. Same as ASan but slower, with debug information and better stack traces.\\nMemSan. This instruments the code with MemorySanitizer to check for uninitialised memory reads. Experimental, needs recent clang on Linux/x86_64.\\nMemSanDbg. Same as MemSan but slower, with debug information, better stack traces and origin tracking.\\nCheck. This activates the compiler warnings that depend on optimization and treats all warnings as errors.\\nSwitching build modes in CMake is simple. For debug mode, enter at the command line:\\ncmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug /path/to/mbedtls_source\\nTo list other available CMake options, use:\\ncmake -LH\\nNote that, with CMake, you can't adjust the compiler or its flags after the initial invocation of cmake. This means that CC=your_cc make and make CC=your_cc will not work (similarly with CFLAGS and other variables). These variables need to be adjusted when invoking cmake for the first time, for example:\\nCC=your_cc cmake /path/to/mbedtls_source\\nIf you already invoked cmake and want to change those settings, you need to remove the build directory and create it again.\\nNote that it is possible to build in-place; this will however overwrite the provided Makefiles (see scripts/tmp_ignore_makefiles.sh if you want to prevent git status from showing them as modified). In order to do so, from the Mbed TLS source directory, use:\\ncmake .\\nmake\\nIf you want to change CC or CFLAGS afterwards, you will need to remove the CMake cache. This can be done with the following command using GNU find:\\nfind . -iname '*cmake*' -not -name CMakeLists.txt -exec rm -rf {} +\\nYou can now make the desired change:\\nCC=your_cc cmake .\\nmake\\nRegarding variables, also note that if you set CFLAGS when invoking cmake, your value of CFLAGS doesn't override the content provided by cmake (depending on the build mode as seen above), it's merely prepended to it.\\nConsuming Mbed TLS\\nMbed TLS provides a package config file for consumption as a dependency in other CMake projects. You can include Mbed TLS's CMake targets yourself with:\\nfind_package(MbedTLS)\\nIf prompted, set MbedTLS_DIR to ${YOUR_MBEDTLS_INSTALL_DIR}/cmake. This creates the following targets:\\nMbedTLS::mbedcrypto (Crypto library)\\nMbedTLS::mbedtls (TLS library)\\nMbedTLS::mbedx509 (X509 library)\\nYou can then use these directly through target_link_libraries():\\nadd_executable(xyz)\\n\\ntarget_link_libraries(xyz\\n    PUBLIC MbedTLS::mbedtls\\n           MbedTLS::mbedcrypto\\n           MbedTLS::mbedx509)\\nThis will link the Mbed TLS libraries to your library or application, and add its include directories to your target (transitively, in the case of PUBLIC or INTERFACE link libraries).\\nMbed TLS as a subproject\\nMbed TLS supports being built as a CMake subproject. One can use add_subdirectory() from a parent CMake project to include Mbed TLS as a subproject.\\nMicrosoft Visual Studio\\nThe build files for Microsoft Visual Studio are generated for Visual Studio 2013.\\nThe solution file mbedTLS.sln contains all the basic projects needed to build the library and all the programs. The files in tests are not generated and compiled, as these need Python and perl environments as well. However, the selftest program in programs/test/ is still available.\\nIn the development branch of Mbed TLS, the Visual Studio solution files need to be generated first as described in “Generated source files in the development branch”.\\nExample programs\\nWe've included example programs for a lot of different features and uses in programs/. Please note that the goal of these sample programs is to demonstrate specific features of the library, and the code may need to be adapted to build a real-world application.\\nTests\\nMbed TLS includes an elaborate test suite in tests/ that initially requires Python to generate the tests files (e.g. test\\\\_suite\\\\_mpi.c). These files are generated from a function file (e.g. suites/test\\\\_suite\\\\_mpi.function) and a data file (e.g. suites/test\\\\_suite\\\\_mpi.data). The function file contains the test functions. The data file contains the test cases, specified as parameters that will be passed to the test function.\\nFor machines with a Unix shell and OpenSSL (and optionally GnuTLS) installed, additional test scripts are available:\\ntests/ssl-opt.sh runs integration tests for various TLS options (renegotiation, resumption, etc.) and tests interoperability of these options with other implementations.\\ntests/compat.sh tests interoperability of every ciphersuite with other implementations.\\ntests/scripts/test-ref-configs.pl test builds in various reduced configurations.\\ntests/scripts/depends.py test builds in configurations with a single curve, key exchange, hash, cipher, or pkalg on.\\ntests/scripts/all.sh runs a combination of the above tests, plus some more, with various build options (such as ASan, full mbedtls_config.h, etc).\\nInstead of manually installing the required versions of all tools required for testing, it is possible to use the Docker images from our CI systems, as explained in our testing infrastructure repository.\\nPorting Mbed TLS\\nMbed TLS can be ported to many different architectures, OS's and platforms. Before starting a port, you may find the following Knowledge Base articles useful:\\nPorting Mbed TLS to a new environment or OS\\nWhat external dependencies does Mbed TLS rely on?\\nHow do I configure Mbed TLS\\nMbed TLS is mostly written in portable C99; however, it has a few platform requirements that go beyond the standard, but are met by most modern architectures:\\nBytes must be 8 bits.\\nAll-bits-zero must be a valid representation of a null pointer.\\nSigned integers must be represented using two's complement.\\nint and size_t must be at least 32 bits wide.\\nThe types uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t and their signed equivalents must be available.\\nMixed-endian platforms are not supported.\\nSIZE_MAX must be at least as big as INT_MAX and UINT_MAX.\\nPSA cryptography API\\nPSA API\\nArm's Platform Security Architecture (PSA) is a holistic set of threat models, security analyses, hardware and firmware architecture specifications, and an open source firmware reference implementation. PSA provides a recipe, based on industry best practice, that allows security to be consistently designed in, at both a hardware and firmware level.\\nThe PSA cryptography API provides access to a set of cryptographic primitives. It has a dual purpose. First, it can be used in a PSA-compliant platform to build services, such as secure boot, secure storage and secure communication. Second, it can also be used independently of other PSA components on any platform.\\nThe design goals of the PSA cryptography API include:\\nThe API distinguishes caller memory from internal memory, which allows the library to be implemented in an isolated space for additional security. Library calls can be implemented as direct function calls if isolation is not desired, and as remote procedure calls if isolation is desired.\\nThe structure of internal data is hidden to the application, which allows substituting alternative implementations at build time or run time, for example, in order to take advantage of hardware accelerators.\\nAll access to the keys happens through key identifiers, which allows support for external cryptoprocessors that is transparent to applications.\\nThe interface to algorithms is generic, favoring algorithm agility.\\nThe interface is designed to be easy to use and hard to accidentally misuse.\\nArm welcomes feedback on the design of the API. If you think something could be improved, please open an issue on our Github repository. Alternatively, if you prefer to provide your feedback privately, please email us at mbed-crypto@arm.com. All feedback received by email is treated confidentially.\\nPSA implementation in Mbed TLS\\nMbed TLS includes a reference implementation of the PSA Cryptography API. However, it does not aim to implement the whole specification; in particular it does not implement all the algorithms.\\nThe X.509 and TLS code can use PSA cryptography for most operations. To enable this support, activate the compilation option MBEDTLS_USE_PSA_CRYPTO in mbedtls_config.h. Note that TLS 1.3 uses PSA cryptography for most operations regardless of this option. See docs/use-psa-crypto.md for details.\\nUpcoming features\\nFuture releases of this library will include:\\nA driver programming interface, which makes it possible to use hardware accelerators instead of the default software implementation for chosen algorithms.\\nSupport for external keys to be stored and manipulated exclusively in a separate cryptoprocessor.\\nA configuration mechanism to compile only the algorithms you need for your application.\\nA wider set of cryptographic algorithms.\\nLicense\\nUnless specifically indicated otherwise in a file, Mbed TLS files are provided under the Apache-2.0 license. See the LICENSE file for the full text of this license. Contributors must accept that their contributions are made under both the Apache-2.0 AND GPL-2.0-or-later licenses. This enables LTS (Long Term Support) branches of the software to be provided under either the Apache-2.0 OR GPL-2.0-or-later licenses.\\nContributing\\nWe gratefully accept bug reports and contributions from the community.

The simplest form is to use the helper method UserCredentials(credsFilepath).\\nnc, err := nats.Connect(url, nats.UserCredentials(\"user.creds\"))\\nThe helper methods creates two callback handlers to present the user JWT and sign the nonce challenge from the server. The core client library never has direct access to your private key and simply performs the callback for signing the server challenge. The helper will load and wipe and erase memory it uses for each connect or reconnect.\\nThe helper also can take two entries, one for the JWT and one for the NKey seed file.\\nnc, err := nats.Connect(url, nats.UserCredentials(\"user.jwt\", \"user.nk\"))\\nYou can also set the callback handlers directly and manage challenge signing directly.\\nnc, err := nats.Connect(url, nats.UserJWT(jwtCB, sigCB))\\nBare Nkeys are also supported.

       " 'D3: Data-Driven Documents\\nD3 (or D3.js) is a JavaScript library for visualizing data using web standards. D3 helps you bring data to life using SVG, Canvas and HTML. D3 combines powerful visualization and interaction techniques with a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation, giving you the full capabilities of modern browsers and the freedom to design the right visual interface for your data.\\nResources\\nIntroduction\\nAPI Reference\\nReleases\\nExamples\\nWiki\\nInstalling\\nIf you use npm, npm install d3. You can also download the latest release on GitHub. For vanilla HTML in modern browsers, import D3 from jsDelivr:\\n<script type=\"module\">\\n\\nimport * as d3 from \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@7/+esm\";\\n\\nconst div = d3.selectAll(\"div\");\\n\\n</script>\\nFor legacy environments, you can load D3’s UMD bundle from an npm-based CDN such as jsDelivr; a d3 global is exported:\\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@7\"></script>\\n<script>\\n\\nconst div = d3.selectAll(\"div\");\\n\\n</script>\\nYou can also use the standalone D3 microlibraries. For example, d3-selection:\\n<script type=\"module\">\\n\\nimport {selectAll} from \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3-selection@3/+esm\";\\n\\nconst div = selectAll(\"div\");\\n\\n</script>\\nD3 is written using ES2015 modules. Create a custom bundle using Rollup, Webpack, or your preferred bundler. To import D3 into an ES2015 application, either import specific symbols from specific D3 modules:\\nimport {scaleLinear} from \"d3-scale\";\\nOr import everything into a namespace (here, d3):\\nimport * as d3 from \"d3\";\\nOr using dynamic import:\\nconst d3 = await import(\"d3\");\\nYou can also import individual modules and combine them into a d3 object using Object.assign:\\nconst d3 = await Promise.all([\\n  import(\"d3-format\"),\\n  import(\"d3-geo\"),\\n  import(\"d3-geo-projection\")\\n]).then(d3 => Object.assign({}, ...d3));']"
